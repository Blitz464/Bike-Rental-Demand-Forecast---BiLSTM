# Bike-Rental-Demand-Forecast---BiLSTM

# Demand Forecasting with biLSTM

## Overview
This project involves the use of a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (biLSTM) model to forecast demand. The model is designed to capture complex patterns in time series data, making it well-suited for predicting future demand based on historical observations.

## Getting Started
To use this notebook, you will need to download the required dataset from Kaggle. Follow the instructions in the notebook to obtain the API command for downloading the dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab or Googlecolab
- Necessary Python packages as listed in the notebook (e.g., TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas)

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.
4. Open the `biLSTM_Demand_Forecast.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions.
